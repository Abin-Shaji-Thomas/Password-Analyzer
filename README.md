# 🔐 Password Analyzer

A powerful utility to evaluate password strength, detect weaknesses, and recommend secure password practices.

## 📌 About

**Password Analyzer** is a cybersecurity tool designed to help users assess the strength of their passwords using entropy calculations and best-practice validations. The tool provides feedback in real-time, helping users build secure and resilient passwords.

This project is part of my internship work under **Pinnacle Labs** as a Cybersecurity Intern.

## 🚀 Features

- Password strength scoring based on entropy
- Weakness detection:
  - Common passwords
  - Repeated characters
  - Sequential patterns
  - Missing character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Detailed recommendations for improvement
- Clean and user-friendly GUI using Tkinter
- Color-coded strength meter for visual feedback
